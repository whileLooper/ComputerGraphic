This repo contains the wokrs from my cs3451 computer graphic course. 
Course Topics:
Output devices, line drawing, 2D and 3D transformations, projection, hidden surfaces, color vision, 
surface reflectance and illumination, texture mapping, shadows, anti-aliasing, hardware graphics pipeline, 
GPU programming, ray tracing, polyhedral models, collision detection, polynomial curves and surfaces, 
subdivision surfaces.
